The cutie mark describes a general type of action/situation the character excels at. Also, unless otherwise stated, the cutie mark must be exceedingly wholesome. Not gonna allow the \"Firebombs\" cutie mark, sorry. Once a character has discovered/earned their cutie mark, they gain the following benefits:\n\nPerforming strenuous or heroic action covered by their cutie mark may regain one willpower.\n\nTaking actions covered under their cutie mark may be considered a non-rolling action, especially if they would have 6 or more dice in their net dicepool. \n\nThey get +1 to any roll covered by their cutie mark, and failures or critical failures may be more comical or instructive than deadly. \n\nFinally, downtime actions covered under their cutie mark may be subject to automatic success, extra rolls, metagame/OOC hints, and ofc that +1 mentioned above. \n\nEg. The pony \"Firebombs\" happens to excel at fabricating and wielding launched explosives. This pony can often work with these weapons with a +1, and sometimes isnt made to roll very easy rolls. During downtime, Firebombs makes technika rolls to create more interesting and destructive weapons, sometimes with the +1, and sometimes with hints like \"you'll want to add Elemental Blast, not Bolt\" and \"Start rolling now so when you get some Astrylite, you'll already have racked up some successes\". During a harrowing adventure, the party was saved by a thermite IED built by Firebombs and launched from a slingshot, to which Firebombs regained a point of willpower.
