                {"p":"dyr valnya is a story-focused DnD style sci-fantasy table-top role playing game in the theme of \"Gates of Ivrel\" and \"Adventure Time\". Each of us makes a character, and then plays as that character. To describe what that character is good at (and not good at) we use points systems like the one described below. More \"dots\" mean your character is good at something, less dots means they aren't as practiced, and no dots means they simply have never tried."},
                {"p":"A point in any character trait is called a \"dot\". Dots are on your character sheet. Rolls are made with a d12, 9 thru 12 are successes, and 12s are re-rolled. One's cancel out successes. The number of relevant dots determine how many d12's are rolled."},

Sometimes using powerful artefacts called Technika, sometimes bizarre forces called Magicka, sometimes coming from worlds rich in the enigmatic substance Astryl, and sometimes by just being better at conventional murder. Demihumans killing demihumans, as it has been ever since there was such a thing as demihuman."},

While it had awesome, terrifying, and mysterious powers at its command, it mostly preferred to subjugate and occupy without bloodshed. The reign of The Commonwealth may have lasted for many hundreds or thousands of years more, However:"},

		{"p":"Evil vicious jet black gibbering madness one cannot look upon nor comprehend. It comes from The Gates, and it cannot be killed. Only items imbued with Magicka/Technika can repel the dyr at all. The bravest battles saw the heroes merely annoy it into retreat, taking heavy loses under its vicious tentacled murder ropes."},

		{"p":"Teams went to every charted planet, and entered the final sacred runes into the Main Gate of every known world. The Gates would allow one final egress, and then would cease all functions forever. And when the Main Gate of a world closed, all the dozens or thousands of Minor Gates would stop too. Gateless, the dyr can no longer threaten that world."},

And all viyas tell stories of past adventures, of heroes long dead, or thyself, and of compatriots, now and to come."},
