## Contributing
##### Overview
The best way to contribute is to make some characters and give us feedback! The best way to give feedback is to create issues for the bugs you find.
##### Issues
* Title
  *  A short, simple snippet about your problem. 
  *  Please use proper nouns
  *  Please avoid saying "broken", "fix", etc..  If it wasn't broken and needing fixing, it wouldn't be an issue. 
  *  Eg. "Player shoots multiple bullets each mouse click"
* Description
  * Provide a description somewhat like the following:
    * What were you doing when the issue occured?
    * What is the exact effect of the issue?
    * What exactly was supposed to happen instead?
  * This format allows to rapid digestion of your issue, and make its easier to reproduce, debug, and correct.  
  * Eg. "I clicked twice on the second stage, and got 400 bullets instead of 4."  
* Labels, Milestones, Assignment, etc..  
  * These are for the devs to help sort and deal with issues effeciently, and we do not expect or want help with this.  
  * Please don't mess with them.
 
##### Development

 * Fork repo || Create branch
 * Prepare your work station
   *  Make sure you have Git , puTTy, WinSCP, and your favorite text editor.
 * Make your changes
   *  `git clone` the repo, and follow the "typical dev workflow" below.  
 *  Do's and Dont's
   *  Don't push to master. If you type `git push` or `git push origin master` you are most likely doing something wrong. 
     * use `git push origin <your_branch_name_goes_here>` instead. 
     * If you are having trouble getting your changes back into master, I'll gladly help|fix|do it for you.   
   *  More to come soon(tm), since no one has messed up the repo (yet)...
 * Submit pull request via github
   * Provide what issue you fixed ( pound sign, then the issue number, eg #42 )
   * Detail your change (aka what you did exactly)
   * Provide additional info to tell others how to test your change (Prove you fixed the issue.)

## Dev Info
### Git
This section will include various git command combonations, to help prevent any **Ooops'** happening to the repo or anyones personal code. 
Some sweet links:

[git command cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

[git markdown guide](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

#### Git command "variables"
Some of these command will have a spot with a vairable, like this: \<variablename\>. 

These will be described here:
* \<branchname\>  The name of the branch you are working on. We are currently *mis*using "master"
* \<variablename\>  from the example, not used.
 

____
#### Typical dev workflow

Before opening the project, pull changes from the repo:
* `git pull`

Then do some work. Once you are done, push the changes into github:
* `git add .`   -   You may have to use the flag "-A"
* `git commit -m "I did this, that, and the other!"`
* `git pull`
* `git push origin <branchname>`


____
#### To Wipe All Local Changes

##### This will destroy any work you have done!
##### Make a copy of your work manually! Run this at your own risk!

* `git fetch origin`
* `git reset --hard origin/master`

____
#### Issues, Branches, etc..
Heres a few links to warm-up:
[Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
[Basic Branching & Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

##### View all branches branch
* `git branch`

##### Making a branch
* `git checkout -b <branchname> `
  *  This is shorthand for these two commands:
  *  `git branch <branchname>`
  *  `git checkout <branchname>`
* `git push origin <branchname> ` 
  * Now github knows about your branch

##### Setting remote for a branch
* `git remote add <remote_server>`
  * OPTIONAL: probably gonna wanna keep this origin
* `git push origin <branchname> ` 
  
##### Deleting a branch locally
* `git branch -D <branchname> `

##### Working in your branch, and not master
To change between branches, simply run the command:
* 'git checkout <branchname>'

##### Merging your branch with master, or some other branch.
coming soon(TM)

## Dev flow

##### Address an Issue, then create a Pull request
This workflow has the user take a fresh issue, make a branch, complete the issue, and merge the branch back into master.

* `git checkout -b <branchname> `
  * Use the issue+number as the name, plus some descriptive text (Eg. For issue#53 use "**iss53-fix-the-bug-we-found**")
  * If you already have the branch, leave out the **-b** flag

Do work as per the typical workflow. Once you have you last commit pushed, do this:
* Goto github.com and create a pull request.
  * [github tut](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
* Assuming the auto-merge feature is working, fill in the details secion and create the merge.
  * If not, github gives you that helper list of commands. Do those.
  * Then try to `git pull`
  * If there are still merge errors, try using the GitGUI
    * I did this and was able to fix the merge super fast.
* At the bottom, there will be a button to merge: Press it.
* Once that is complete, github will say that you can delete the branch. Do that too.
  * Your commits aren't deleted, they are moved to be under 'master', and so your branch contains no useful info now.
* On the command line, run the following commands
  * `git pull origin <branchname>`
    * This will inform you your branch is gone.
    * This step may not be needed. I did it and everything worked in the end.
  * `git checkout master`
  * `git pull origin master`
* At this point you should be in master, and have all your changes from the branch. You're done!
